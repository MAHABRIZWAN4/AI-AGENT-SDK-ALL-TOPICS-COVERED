# What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is like a big “traffic controller” for AI models.
It helps you connect your code to many different AI models without writing separate code for each one.

## For example:

You write one simple connection using OpenRouter.
Behind the scenes, OpenRouter sends your request to the model you choose.
This makes it easy to try or switch between different AI models, or even combine them.
